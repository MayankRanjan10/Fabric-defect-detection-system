# Fabric-defect-detection-system

Along with quantitative production quality production is also very much important in any industry. In textile industry sometime the clothes get defected during the manufacturing process due to various region. Previously the defect detection is done by human eye, in which error is possible and the process was slow because human eye cannot detect each and every error with accuracy and speed. With the increase in population and modern lifestyle of people the textile industry has to increase the production with correct quality check methods because a single defect can reduce the price of product from 45-60%.
So, to deal with this problem a computer based automatic fabric defect detection system was introduced, which will increase the rate of production of fabric and decrease the production of defect product. There is 23 different type of defect that can be there in a fabric e.g. shade variation, stains, knots, vertical & horizontal holes, needle line, broken or missing end, out of which 10 types of defect can be detected by the method we used in this project.
